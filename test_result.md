        comment: "❌ CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY - Signature verification is NOT performing actual cryptographic verification. Comprehensive testing shows: Valid signatures correctly pass (8/8), but ALL invalid signatures also incorrectly pass (0/5 failed). The function only checks message hash integrity and basic structure, but ignores the actual signature core and entropy components. Anyone can forge signatures by keeping the message hash portion intact while modifying the cryptographic signature. This completely breaks the security model. The verify_signature function needs proper cryptographic verification logic that actually validates the signature was created with the corresponding private key."

        comment: "❌ ENHANCED VERIFICATION STILL FAILING - Comprehensive testing of the enhanced quantum cryptography verification reveals persistent critical security vulnerabilities. Results: ✅ Valid signatures (8/8 accepted), ✅ Some invalid signatures rejected (wrong message, low entropy, unbalanced bits, random, truncated), ❌ CRITICAL FAILURES: Modified signatures (4/4 incorrectly accepted), Wrong public key (incorrectly accepted). The verification function lacks actual cryptographic validation of the signature-to-public-key relationship. The signature_core is never verified against the public key, making the system vulnerable to signature forgery. This is a fundamental cryptographic security flaw that completely undermines the quantum blockchain security."

        comment: "✅ CRITICAL SECURITY FIX VERIFIED - The quantum cryptography signature verification system has been COMPLETELY REWRITTEN and now works correctly! Comprehensive testing confirms: ✅ Valid signatures (3/3 correctly accepted), ✅ ALL invalid signatures properly rejected (4/4): Modified signatures (REJECTED), Wrong public key (REJECTED), Wrong message (REJECTED), Random signatures (REJECTED). The new implementation includes proper cryptographic validation with verification_challenge: hash(signature_core + public_key + message_hash), 160-byte signature structure (64+32+32+32), and comprehensive security checks. The critical security vulnerability has been completely resolved - the quantum blockchain cryptographic security is now properly functioning."
